## Features
- Predictive modeling using LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, XGBRegressor, StackingRegressor
- Data analysis and visualization of sales trends
- Insightful findings on consumer buying behavior

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, xgboost

## How to Use
